															<p>From June to August of 2017, I worked with the
															Merchant Fulfilled Network's engineering team at the
															Amazon campus in Seattle, Washington. During my nine
															weeks in Seattle, I sought to push the use of Voice
															User Interfaces (specifically, Alexa) beyond leuisurely
															use at home and into the realm of online merchants and
															high-volume retail businesses. My personal
															responsibilities included designing, developing, and
															deploying an Amazon Marketplace Alexa Skill that
															provides third-party Marketplace Sellers with data
															about their received Amazon.com orders.
															</p>
															I created an AWS Lambda Function, written in
															Node.js, to provide back-end functionality, while
															utilizing AWS S3 and DynamoDB as databases for storing
															files and data. Crafting a front-end Voice User
															Interface (VUI), automating interactions with highly
															sensitive Amazon Seller account information, and coming
															up with inventive yet practical applications of
															regression models for Sellers proved to be extremely
															exciting challenges.

													<p></p>In October of 2016, I started working as a part-time
													Salesforce Developer and Administrator at <a href=
													"http://ipira.berkeley.edu/">Intellectual Property and
													Industry Research Alliances</a> (IPIRA), which is a
													department that manages intellectual property data,
													copyrights, and patents for inventions and research in
													Berkeley.</p>
													<p>Over the past few months, I have developed and
													deployed (with the help of two other developers) an
													online Invention Disclosure Portal, which allows
													inventors to submit a web-based disclosure form and
													automatically loads information and data into our
													Salesforce org. This involved over a thousand lines of
													code on both the front end and back end, utilization of
													Salesforce's programming languages (e.g. Apex and
													Visualforce markup) and APIs, and administration and
													ETL of over 12,000 user records on the Salesforce
													platform.<br></p>
													New features I have developed include:<br>
													- Shared-access privileges (allowing multiple inventors
													to fill out a single disclosure)<br>
													- An improved user interface, written with Salesforce’s
													Visualforce markup language (similar to HTML) and
													static CSS styling resources<br>
													- Back-end Apex controllers that triggers workflows
													within the Intellectual Property department<br>
													- Automatic PDF generation<br>
													- Automated sending of custom emails (using a
													controller that links inventor info to contacts in the
													UC Berkeley directory)
													<br><br>I am currently working on an online Software
													Disclosure Form specifically for developers seeking
													licensing and patents for their software products.

													<p>
													From June to August of 2015, I interned at the
													San Francisco Department of Technology, where I worked
													with the development/project management team of the
													<a href="https://businessportal.sfgov.org/">SF Business
													Portal</a>. The SF Business Portal is an online
													government digital service that helps local users start
													businesses by providing a simple yet comprehensive
													step-by-step guide, as well as all the permits,
													licensing, and information that new business owners
													needs to start and grow in the city.
													</p>
													<p>
													I edited and tested front-end site content and
													design, and I also consolidated business permit data
													from over 26 San Francisco city department in order to
													make the process of starting a business streamlined,
													intuitive, and custom-tailored to each specific type of
													business.
													</p>
													On the non-technical side, this involved a LOT of
													flowcharts, spreadsheets, phone calls, visits to city
													departments, and even a personal visit to mayor Ed
													Lee's main office. I loved the opportunity to
													participate in the many interactions between the
													development teams of different city departments,
													between private sector tech companies (such as
													Salesforce and Google) and government departments, and
													between locals businesses and the City and Country of
													San Francisco.
